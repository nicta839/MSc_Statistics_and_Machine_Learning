    "In the assignment above we have fixed $\\sigma_\\mu$ to a small value. Conceptually it would have been straightforward to learn also this parameter with the EM algorithm. However, unfortunately, the maximum likelihood estimate of $\\sigma_\\mu$ often ends up being too large to result in accurate _long term predictions_. The reason for this issue is that the structural model\n",

    "is not a perfect description of reality. As a consequence, when learning the parameters the mismatch between the model and the data is compensated for by increasing the noise variances. This results in a trend component which does not only capture the long term trends of the data, but also seemingly random variations due to a model misspecification, possibly resulting in poor _long range predictions_.\n",

    "Kitagawa (Introduction to Time Series Modeling, CRC Press, 2010, Section 12.3) discusses this issue and proposes two solutions. The first is a simple and pragmatic one: simply fix $\\sigma_\\mu^2$ to a value smaller than the maximum likelihood estimate. This is the approach we have taken in this assignment. The issue is of course that in practice it is hard to know what value to pick, which boild down to manual trial and error (or, if you are lucky, the designer of the lab assignment will tell you which value to use!).\n",

It is straightforward to include this new component in the state space representation (how?) and to run the Kalman filter and smoother on the resulting model. Indeed, this is one of the beauties with working with the state space representation of time series data! However, the M-step of the EM algorithm becomes a bit more involved if we want to use the method to estimate also the AR coefficients of the $\\nu$-component, which is beyond the scope of this lab assignment."
